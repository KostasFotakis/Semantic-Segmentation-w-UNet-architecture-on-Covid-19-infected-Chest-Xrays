# Semantic-Segmentation-w-UNet-architecture-on-Covid-19-infected-Chest-Xrays
Training and Deployment of UNet model, for the segmentation and extraction of the region of interest (i.e. Lung area) on our Chest X-rays dataset. Deployment of our CNN model (check previous repo.) on the newly segmented imagery and evaluation. Implemented on Python, with the help of the Machine Learning libraries TensorFlow and Keras. Many thanks to rani700 for the help!
